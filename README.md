# Tesla Stock Data Analysis — Understanding Day-to-Day Market Behavior

This repository contains an exploratory analysis of **Tesla (TSLA) stock data** with the goal of understanding how the stock behaves from one trading day to the next.

I built this notebook to spend time with the data — observing price movements, volatility, and changes in trading activity — and to build intuition about how real financial time-series data behaves. The focus is on analysis and understanding.


## What this analysis explores

The notebook walks through:

- Inspecting Tesla’s historical price and volume data  
- Understanding the time-series structure and granularity  
- Exploring daily price movements and trends  
- Observing how volatility evolves over time  
- Examining changes in trading activity  
- Constructing time-aware features from historical data  

Each step is guided by simple questions about what the data is showing and why.

- Understand how noisy market data can still reveal structure  
- Appreciate the importance of respecting time order in analysis  
- See how feature construction shapes interpretation  

This type of exploratory work forms a strong foundation for any future modeling or deeper investigation.
